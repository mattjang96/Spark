With the proven weaknesses of static analysis and signature-matching methods, like YARA, we shifted gears to Apache Spark, an open-source cluster computing framework. I was part of Qubit Security's transition to implementing machine learning to <a href="https://www.plura.io/">Plura.io</a>, the company's real-time anti-hacking cloud application. Accordingly, I was responsible for studying and investigating routes within Spark's MLlib, its machine leanring library. Here are some of the documentations from my studies.
